# Instructions
Given an alphabet (where each symbol is represented by a character and a decimal value with the code of the symbol), you need to implement a fixed-length code decompressor based on the following steps:

# Read the contents of the input file using input redirection (STDIN). The format of the input file is as follows:
- An integer value representing the number of symbols in the alphabet

- n lines (where n is the number of symbols in the alphabet) with a char representing the value of the symbol and an integer value representing the symbol's code (in decimal notation).

- A string representing the compressed message (sequence of bits).

Given the previous format, the following file represents a valid input file:

3
a 2
b 4
c 5
010010010100101101101

# Calculate the number of bits of the fixed-length codes based on the value of the greatest base 10 code in the alphabet. For decimal values greater than zero, you can use the following formula to calculate the number of bits of the fixed-length codes: ceiling(log_2(greatest_base_10_code_in_the_alphabet +1))

# Create n child threads (where n is the number of symbols in the alphabet). Each child thread executes the following tasks:
- Determines the binary representation of the symbol's code.

- Determines the frequency of the symbol in the compressed message.

- Print the character, binary code, and frequency of the assigned symbol.

# Create m child processes or threads (where m is the number of characters in the decompressed message) to determine each character of the decompressed message. 

# Print the decompressed message.

Given the expected input, the expected output is:
Alphabet:
Character: a, Code: 010, Frequency: 3
Character: b, Code: 100, Frequency: 1
Character: c, Code: 101, Frequency: 3

Decompressed message: aaabccc
